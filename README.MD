# What is this?

A JSON compressor. It compresses data using the LZMA algorithm. It uses a port of LZMA-JS to TypeScript. Check out the original repo here:
[link](https://github.com/LZMA-JS/LZMA-JS)

# Why?

Divine Star has several projects that need to store compressed JSON data. All of Divine Star’s projects are written in TypeScript. The node module did not have a TypeScript version and was not as flexible as needed. This module makes it easy to move the compression and decompression into any context within an Electron node-integration environment or server side.. 

# Current Features

- Read in compressed JSON
- Write a compressed JSON file 
- Change Compression Level
